# Module 2 Challenge

## Description

This project is to create my web development portfolio. My portfolio showcases samples of my work for employers to view and assess as they look for candidates to fill roles. The main page of the portfolio gives a preview of my work and provides the ability to navigate to each individual project for further viewing and interaction.
